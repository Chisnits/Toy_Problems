In this Kata, you will be given a string and two indexes. Your task is to reverse the portion of that string between those two indexes inclusive.

solve("codewars",1,5) = "cawedors" -- elements at index 1 to 5 inclusive are "odewa". So we reverse them.
solve("cODEWArs", 1,5) = "cAWEDOrs" -- to help visualize.
Input will be lowercase and uppercase letters only.

More examples in the test cases!

Good luck!


SOLUTION:

function solve(st,a,b){
  var list = []
 for(var i=0; i < st.length; i++){

     loop through the str to find the letters in between
     the index's provided.

   if(i >= a && i <= b){
    push the letters into an array.
     list.push(st[i])
   }
 }

 reverse the letters in the array

var reversed = list.reverse()

replace the letters in the original string with
the reversed letters at the correct index.

var s = st.substr(0, a) + reversed + st.substr(b + 1);

cut out the commas placed in while pushing to an array.

return s.replace(/,/g, '')
}
