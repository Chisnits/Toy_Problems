You are going to be given a word. Your job is to return the middle character of the 
word. If the word's length is odd, return the middle character. If the word's 
length is even, return the middle 2 characters.

EX:
Kata.getMiddle("test") should return "es"

Kata.getMiddle("testing") should return "t"

Kata.getMiddle("middle") should return "dd"

Kata.getMiddle("A") should return "A"

SOLUTION:

function getMiddle(s) {
  var position;
  var length;
  if(s.length % 2 === 0){ 
    position = s.length / 2 - 1;
    length = 2;
    //if the string length is divisible by 2 with a remainder of 0 (even),
    //then take the string length, divide it by 2 to get the middle,
    //then -1 because we're taking 2 letters instead of just one.
  } else if (s.length % 2 === 1){
    position = s.length / 2;
    length = 1;
    //if the string length is divisible by 2 with a remainder of 1 (odd),
    //then take the string length, divide it by 2 to get the middle.
  }
  return s.substring(position, position + length)
//   substring extracts characters from indexStart up to but not including indexEnd.
}
