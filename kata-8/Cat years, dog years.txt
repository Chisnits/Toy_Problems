I have a cat and a dog.

I got them at the same time as kitten/puppy. That was humanYears or human_years years ago.

Return their respective ages now as [humanYears,catYears,dogYears] or [human_years,cat_years,dog_years]

NOTES:

humanYears >= 1
Cat Years
15 cat years for first year
+9 cat years for second year
+4 cat years for each year after that
Dog Years
15 dog years for first year
+9 dog years for second year
+5 dog years for each year after that

SOLUTION:
var humanYearsCatYearsDogYears = function(humanYears) {
  function catYearAdder(year){
    var x = year - 2
    var y = 15 + 9;
    var z = x * 4;
    return (y+z)
  }
  function dogYearAdder(year){
    var x = year - 2
    var y = 15 + 9;
    var z = x * 5;
    return (y+z)
  }
  var totalYears = []
  let firstDogYear = 15;
  let firstCatYear = 15;
    if(humanYears === 1){
      totalYears.push(humanYears, firstCatYear, firstDogYear)
    } else if (humanYears === 2){
      let cat2 = firstCatYear + 9
      let dog2 = firstDogYear + 9
      totalYears.push(humanYears, dog2 , cat2)
    }  else if (humanYears > 2){
      totalYears.push(humanYears, catYearAdder(humanYears), dogYearAdder(humanYears))
    }
  console.log(totalYears)
  return totalYears
}
